Source code to the demo part of Insert Coins by Traction & deMarche, released at TUM 2005. 

Originally compiled with MSVC6. The demo engine code written by Vulture is not included except in a lib/dll form, but you can find some version in https://github.com/elsewhere/iam/tree/master/demotractor if you are curious. 
Have fun :)
